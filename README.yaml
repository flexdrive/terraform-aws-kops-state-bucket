    Terraform module to provision the state bucket for `kops`
  
    The module supports the following:
  
    1. Forced server-side encryption at rest for the S3 bucket
    2. S3 bucket versioning to allow for `kops` state recovery in the case of accidental deletions or human errors
    3. Block public access in bucket level by default
  
  # How to use this project
  usage: |-
    It will also create an S3 bucket with the name `fdpfm-<tenant>-kops-state` for storing `kops` state.
  
    ```hcl
    module "kops" {
      source           = "git::https://github.com/flexdrive/terraform-aws-kops-state-bucket.git?ref=master"
      namespace        = "eg"
      stage            = "prod"
      name             = "kops-state"
      region           = "us-east-1"
    }
    ```
